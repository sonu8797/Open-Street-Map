# About
This is a Command Line Interface platform to parse an OpenStreetMap made using the C++
Programming language.

The platform parses the node and way information from the .osm file and allows the user to search
an element by matching the input string with the substring of the name.

The platform provides the feature to find the first k closest nodes of any node and also the shortest
distance between any two nodes.
